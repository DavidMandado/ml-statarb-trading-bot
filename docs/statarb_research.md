# Statistical Arbitrage Research

This document serves as a comprehensive research report on Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb) — a popular quantitative trading strategy. It covers the fundamentals, historical context, key concepts, methodologies, and practical implementation insights. The goal is to build a strong theoretical foundation that will inform the development of our Machine Learning-Driven Statistical Arbitrage Trading Bot.

## 1. Introduction

**Statistical Arbitrage** refers to a class of trading strategies that use mathematical models and statistical methods to identify price inefficiencies between financial instruments. These strategies aim to exploit temporary mispricings while maintaining a market-neutral stance, reducing exposure to overall market risk.

StatArb is widely used by hedge funds and proprietary trading firms due to its ability to generate consistent returns by capitalizing on mean-reverting behaviors in asset prices.

## 2. Historical Context

Statistical arbitrage strategies emerged from academic research in the 1980s and gained traction in the 1990s as computational power increased. Early pioneers of these methods applied rigorous statistical techniques to the financial markets, laying the groundwork for modern quantitative trading strategies.

- **Evolution:** From simple pairs trading to more complex multi-asset portfolios.
- **Adoption:** Popularized by hedge funds in the early 2000s and continuously refined with advances in machine learning and high-frequency trading.

## 3. Key Concepts

### 3.1 Mean Reversion
Mean reversion is the theory that asset prices tend to return to their historical average over time. In the context of StatArb, this concept underpins the idea that temporary deviations from the norm are likely to reverse.

- **Application:** Detecting when an asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical average.
- **Tools:** Statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test are commonly used to assess mean reversion.

### 3.2 Cointegration
Cointegration is a statistical property where two or more non-stationary time series are linked by a long-term, stable relationship. In trading, cointegrated asset pairs are expected to move together over time despite short-term deviations.

- **Importance:** Identifying cointegrated pairs is crucial for constructing reliable pairs trading strategies.
- **Testing:** The Johansen test and Engle-Granger two-step method are popular approaches.

### 3.3 Pairs Trading
Pairs trading involves identifying two historically correlated securities and taking offsetting positions when the price relationship deviates from its historical norm.

- **Mechanism:** Go long on the undervalued asset and short the overvalued asset, betting on the convergence of their price ratio.
- **Risk Management:** Ensuring a market-neutral stance minimizes systematic risk.

## 4. Methodologies and Techniques

### 4.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Sources:** Historical price data can be sourced from APIs such as Yahoo Finance (yFinance), Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.
- **Cleaning:** Handling missing data, normalizing price series, and adjusting for corporate actions (dividends, splits).

### 4.2 Feature Engineering
- **Technical Indicators:** Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and momentum indicators can be used as features.
- **Statistical Tests:** Use the ADF test to check for stationarity and cointegration tests to validate relationships between asset pairs.

### 4.3 Model Development
- **Predictive Models:** Implement machine learning models (e.g., regression, SVM, neural networks) to predict the probability and duration of mean reversion.
- **Backtesting Framework:** Leverage backtesting libraries (such as Backtrader or Zipline) to simulate historical performance and refine strategy parameters.

### 4.4 Risk Management
- **Position Sizing:** Apply methods such as the Kelly criterion or fixed fractional risk models.
- **Stop Losses and Take Profits:** Establish clear rules for closing positions to manage drawdowns.

## 5. Practical Implementation: An Outline

The ultimate goal is to integrate these statistical techniques with machine learning models to develop an automated trading bot. Here’s a rough implementation outline:

1. **Data Pipeline:**
   - Automate data collection, cleaning, and storage.
   - Store raw data in `data/raw/` and processed data in `data/processed/`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Use Jupyter notebooks (located in `notebooks/`) for initial data exploration.
   - Visualize trends, correlations, and stationarity tests.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Develop and train machine learning models to predict deviations.
   - Evaluate model performance using backtesting results.

4. **Bot Development:**
   - Integrate the predictive model into a trading strategy.
   - Implement risk management and order execution modules in the `src/` directory.

5. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Document every improvement, test, and experiment.
   - Update the learning journal and commit changes with detailed commit messages.
